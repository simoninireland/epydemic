:class:`NetworkStatistics`: A process to collect summary statistics
===================================================================

.. currentmodule:: epydemic

.. autoclass:: NetworkStatistics

A statistics process is intended to be composed with another process, for
which it collects a common set of summary network statistics. This allows
standart statistics to be collected from any ``epydemic`` process.

The statistics gathered are:

- The order of the network (number of nodes)
- The number of edges
- The mean degree of nodes
- The degree histogram
- The number of connected components
- The number of nodes in the :term:`largest connected component`
- The number of nodes in the second-largest connected component

The process runs in the results-gathering phase, where is analyses the topology
and features of the final network.
