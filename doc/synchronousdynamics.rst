Running a dynamics
------------------

Synchronous dynamics works as follows:

* Any events posted for (or before) the current simulation time are
  fired by calling :meth:`Dynamics.runPendingEvents`.
* The dynamics accesses the underlying process to acquire the event
  distribution for per-element events by calling
  :meth:`Process.perElementEventDistribution`.
* For each locus having elements, it selects each element in turn and
  fires an event on that element with the probability given for that
  event, and records this through the event tap.
* The dynamics then accesses the fixed-rate event distribution of the
  process by calling :meth:`Process.fixedRateEventDistribution`
* For each non-empty locus, it fires at event with the probability
  given for that event and records this through the event tap.
* The current simulation time is updated.
* This continues until the process indicates that it has reached
  equilibrium, as determined by :meth:`Process.atEqulibrium`.
