:class:`NetworkExperiment`: An experiment over a network
========================================================

.. currentmodule:: epydemic

.. autoclass:: NetworkExperiment
   :show-inheritance:


In use
------

:class:`NetworkExperiment` simply adds functions to associate a netywork or a network
generator with a computational experiment.

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.network

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.setNetworkGenerator

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.networkGenerator

During set-up the experiment instantiates a working copy network for use within the experiment,
deleting it afterwards. If the experiment was provided with a single "prototype" network,
whis is copied each time; if it was provided with an instance of :class:`NetworkGenerator`, a new instance of
the class of networks defined by the generator is used.

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.setUp

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.tearDown


Event taps
----------

Whenever the network changes, there is an opportunity for the experiment
to log it or take some other action. We refer to this as the *event
tap*, as it captures the entire stream of events regardless of how
they are defined. See :ref:`event-taps` for a discussion.

To use the event tap interface, you need to override these
methods (they all have empty defaults) and ensure that they're called
from the right places.

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.eventFired

There are three other methods that are called within the core of the
experiment to set up and manage the event tap.

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.initialiseEventTaps

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.simulationStarted

.. automethod:: NetworkExperiment.simulationEnded

This is simply an interface definition: all the default
implementations are empty. To use the event taps you need to override
these methods for every experiment. The methods should be called as
follows:

- :meth:`NetworkExperiment.initialiseEventTaps`: Early in the
  construction process, to allow any data structures to be created.
- :meth:`NetworkExperiment.simulationStarted`: After any set-up and
  immediately before the work of the experiment (simulation) starts,
  so that the overridden method gets to see the experiment right
  before execution.
- :meth:`NetworkExperiment.eventFired`: Immediately after each
  "event", however defined, to that the overridden method gets to see
  the effect that the method had.
- :meth:`NetworkExperiment.simulationEnded`: After the last event
  and before any tear-down, so that the overridden method gets to see
  the final result of the simulation.

For example, in :class:`StochasticDynamics`,
:meth:`NetworkExperiment.initialiseEventTaps` is called from the
constructor of :class:`Dynamics`;
:meth:`NetworkExperiment.simulationStarted` is called before the first
stochastic event is drawn;
:meth:`NetworkExperiment.eventFired` is called immediately after each
event function has been called, for both stochastic and
posted events;
and :meth:`NetworkExperiment.simulationEnded` is called after the last
stochastic event has been fired.
