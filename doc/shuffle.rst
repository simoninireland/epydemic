Shuffle processes: Degree-preserving rewirings of networks
==========================================================

.. currentmodule:: epydemic

``epydemic`` includes processes that rewire networks ahead of
experiments. These processes are inspired by the work reported in
Melnik *et alia* :cite:`UnreasonableEffectiveness` and can be used for a number of different
purposes, for example creating a "random" version of an empirical
network or for reducing clustering and other structures without
changing the degree distribution.
