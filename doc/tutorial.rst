Tutorial
========

This page is a tutorial introduction to ``epydemic``. It begins with an overview of the
class class structure of the library, and then uses it to build and run a simulation
of an epidemic.

If you want more examples of ``epydemic`` in action, it forms the basis for a
:ref:`book <Dob20>` on epidemic modelling.
