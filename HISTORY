Version 0.99.2 (v1.0 release candidate 2) 2020-03-16

   - Moved development to Python3.7
   - Added "wheel" distribution format, updated to simpler build system
   - Fully merged process-refactor branch
   - Updated library dependencies
   - Added an interface to evolve and interact with the network, which means that
     things compose more cleanly
   - Removed a lot of unnecessary parameter-passing after the refactoring, including
     simplifying event functions and compartment management
   - Added posting of repeated events
   - Added cookbook article on monitoring processes
   - Added recording time an edge became occupied
   - Added some badges to README.rst

Version 0.5.1 2018-07-27

   - Fixed bug in the event selection routine for Gillespie dynamics
   - Added shuffling of events to avoid anomalies in event selection
   - Syntax changes to be Python3 compatible
