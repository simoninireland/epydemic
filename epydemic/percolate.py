class Percolate(Process):
    '''A process that bond percolates a network with a given occupation
    probability. This can be used independently as a basis for
    percolation experiments, or as a precursor to other processes that
    need to run on a percolated network.

    The default behaviour is that edges left unoccupied by the
    percolation process are removed, with the set of nodes being left
    unaffected. This can be overridden by sub-classes.

    Note that the percolation process defines no events: it performs
    percolation during the :meth:`build` method.

    def percolate(self, T: float):
        '''Percolate the network. Edges are retained ("occupied") with
        probability :math:`T`, with other edges being "unoccupied"
        with probability :math:`(1 - T)`. The edges are divided into
        two sets based on occupation, and then passed to the
        corresponding action method: :meth:`Percolation.occupy` for
        the occupied edges and :meth:`Percolation.unoccupy` for the
        unoccupied edges. (These two methods are called in that order,
        which may be important for sub-classes that need to, for example,
        examine or manipulate the network before :meth:`Percolation.unoccupy`
        removes the unoccupied edges..)

        The implementation of the percolation process borrows heavily from
        the Newman-Ziff approach, whereby the set of edges is shuffled
        and the leading fraction :math:`T` is treated as occupied. This
        is considerably faster than performing a random choice per edge.
