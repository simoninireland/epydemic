'''`epydemic` is a library for performing simulations for a range of
epidemic spreading (and other) processes, simulated over networks
represented using `networkx`.

Epidemic processes are very important in both network science and its
applications. The most common application is to study the was in which
diseases progress in different network conditions, depending on their
infectiousness and other properties. Typically such processes are
modelled as a :term:`compartmented model of disease` with conditional
probabilities for moving between compartments (familiar to
computer scientists as stochastic finite state machines).

`epydemic` provides the basic simulation machinery for performing
epidemic simulations under two different simulation regimes:
synchronous :term:`discrete time` simulation in which time proceeds in
discrete time intervals, and stochastic or Gillespie :term:`continuous
time` simulations which are better for handling a wider range of
:term:`event` probabilities (but which are slightly harder to
specify).

`epydemic` also provides processes not directly connected with
epidemic modelling but which are often used alongside disease
models. This includes support for add/delete networks and percolation
processes, as well as support for studying the percolation transition
in networks and using generating functions to analyse their
behaviour. Individual network processes can be combined in different
ways to encourage good software engineering practices.
