class Process():
    """A process that runs over a network. This is the abstract base class
    for all network processes.  It provides the essential routines to
    build, set-up, run, and extract results from a
    process. Sub-classes provide the actual behaviour by defining
    simulation events and attaching them to the network in different
    ways.

    A process definition is largely declarative, in the sense that it
    sets up event handlers and their probabilities. These are used by
    a process dynamics (a sub-class of :class:`Dynamics`) to actually
    run a simulation of the process.

    Process can be composed into larger structures, for example as part of
    a :class:`ProcessSequence`.

    The process class includes an interface for interacting with the
    working network. The basic interface is extended and overridden in
    different sub-classes that interact with the network in different
    ways.
