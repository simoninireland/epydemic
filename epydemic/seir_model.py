class SEIR(CompartmentedModel):
    '''The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed :term:`compartmented model of disease`.
    A susceptible node becomes exposed when infected by either an exposed or an infected
    neighbour. Exposed nodes become infected (symptomatic) to infected and then recover
    to removed.

    In contrast to the more familiar :class:`SIR` model, SEIR has two
    compartments that can pass infection. The utility of the model from two aspects:
    exploring what fraction of the contract tree arises from infected individuals
    *versus* exposed individuals, capturing the significance of asymptomatic infection;
    and allowing countermeasures to be applied to symptomatic individuals whose presence
    could be more easily detected than those who are exposed by asymptomatic.

    The SEIR model in `epydemic` is very flexible, allowing different infection probabilities
    for susceptible-exposed or susceptible-infected interactions. The initial seed population
    is placed into :attr:`EXPOSED`, rather than into :attr:`INFECTED` as happens
    for :class:`SIR`.'''
