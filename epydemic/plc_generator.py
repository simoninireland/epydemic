class PLCNetwork(NetworkGenerator):
    '''A generator for networks with a powerlaw-with-cutoff degree distribution.

    PLC networks are commonly used to represent the basic structure of human contact
    networks, where we want to cutoff the degree to stop it becoming "too high" to
    be credible: Newman :cite:`NewmanEpidemicDisease` (and other works) use this topology extensively.
    It is characterised by two parameters, the exponent of the power law and the
    cutoff maximum degree after which the probability of finding nodes with larger degrees
    falls off exponentially.

    Internally we use the configuration model :cite:`MolloyReed` to
    create the network.
