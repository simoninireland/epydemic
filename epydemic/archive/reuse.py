class Reuse(NetworkGenerator):
    '''A network generator that attempts to re-use networks from an
    epydemic archive.

    The networks re-used can be constrained by tag or by metadata.
    Any network accessed is excluded from future re-use by this
    object, *not* generally: it's possible for other re-users to
    use the same network.

    The archive is searched for a chunk of networks, 1 by default. The
    pool of networks from which a chunk is drawn can be set to ensure
    that a sufficient ensemble of networks is drawn from.
    Networks are only downloaded as they are requested to be generated.

    If the base URI is not provided it is loaded from the SERVER_URI
    environment variable.  If the API key is not provided it is loaded
    from the API_KEY environment variable. This allows programs that
    populate an archive to be configured from their runtime
    environment.  Exceptions are raised if these values aren't
    available.

    :param uri: (optional) the base URI of the archive
    :param api_key: (optional) the API key to authenticate against the archive
    :param tags: (optional) tags on candidate networks
    :param metadata: (optional) metadata constraints on candidate networks
    :param exclude: (optional) list of networks to exclude (defaults to None)
    :param chunk: (optional) networks requested per chunk (defaults to 1)
    :param pool: (optional) minimum pool from which to draw (defaults to none)
