class Dynamics(NetworkExperiment):
    '''An abstract simulation framework for running a process over a network.

    This is the abstract base class for implementing different kinds
    of network process dynamics as computational experiments suitable
    for running under ``epyc``. Sub-classes provide synchronous and
    stochastic (Gillespie) simulation dynamics.

    The dynamics runs a network process provided as a :class:`Process`
    object. It is provided with a network generator that is called to
    generate a new experimental network instance for each run. The
    generator can be any iterator but will typically be an instance of
    :class:`NetworkGenerator`.

    :param p: network process to run
    :param g: (optional) prototype network or network generator'''
